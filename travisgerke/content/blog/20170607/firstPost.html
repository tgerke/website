title: "Setting up blogdown"

<p>Needing a site redesign, I spent several weeks (er, months?) fiddling with Skeleton and, later, Foundation off and on. Both great frameworks but, for me, there just weren’t enough hours in the day. Then, I spotted the following from Julia Silge.</p>

After about 10 minutes of fiddling with blogdown (and, apparently, thanking my lucky stars that I don’t have existing hmtl widgets), I committed the following:

<p>Seriously, blogdown is incredible. I spent a handful of evenings wrangling the site design to my liking, and here we are! As a bonus, who would have thought web design could be done mostly in R?</p>
<p>I won’t give a thorough walkthrough; thankfully, this has been beautifully covered by Amber Thomas <a href="https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/">here</a>, and she and Yihui Xie are currently working on a web-book <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">here</a>. To quickly summarize my steps, here are the few lines that built this thing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(devtools)
devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/blogdown&quot;)
blogdown::install_hugo()

setwd(&quot;/myWebsiteDirectory/&quot;)

blogdown::new_site(theme = &quot;nurlansu/hugo-sustain&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>I customized the <a href="https://github.com/nurlansu/hugo-sustain">Sustain theme</a>, but you can generally pick from most of the Hugo themes. I later decided I also wanted to add in a CV page under the <a href="https://github.com/nurlansu/hugo-vitae">Vitae theme</a>, so I created a subdirectory for those pages:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setwd(&quot;/myWebsiteDirectory/vitae&quot;)

blogdown::new_site(theme = &quot;nurlansu/hugo-vitae&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Since the vitae theme is essentially a single html page, I simply tailored it the way I wanted and copied the index.html file over from the public folder into the Content directory of my Sustain-themed main site. I’m pretty happy with the resulting hack for installing two themes in the same site.</p>
<p>I did a similar thing for my publications page, which was initially built from <code>blogdown::new_content(&quot;publications.Rmd&quot;, kind=&quot;single&quot;)</code> and then transferred into Content.</p>
<p>From here on, new blog entries and page updates happen through the following two lines:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># make a new blog entry
blogdown::new_content(&quot;blog/2017XXXX/PostName.Rmd&quot;, kind=&quot;single&quot;)

# locally serve the site
blogdown:::serve_site()</code></pre>
<p>Something it took me a few minutes to figure out: the site was navigating fine in RStudio, but when I opened it in Chrome/Safari, none of the links were locally directed. To make links relative, the following line must be in your config.toml file <code>relativeurls = true</code> (this parameter was absent from the initial config file delivered with Sustain).</p>
<p>Lastly, the Font Awesome icons are amazing and used everywhere; however, they don’t include some of the more academic links (e.g. Google Scholar, arXiv) that one might wish to use. Check <a href="http://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/">academicons</a> to get your fix.</p>
