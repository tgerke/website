<p>Needing a site redesign, I spent several weeks fiddling with skeleton and, later, Foundation off and on. There just weren’t enough hours in the day. Then, I spotted the following tweet from Julia Silge, and just over a week later, all is good using blogdown. Who would have thought web design could be done mostly in R?</p>
<p>I won’t give a thorough walkthrough; thankfully, this has been beautifully covered by Amber Thomas here, and the authors of blogdown are currently working on a web-book here. Here are the few lines that built this thing though:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(devtools)
devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/blogdown&quot;)
blogdown::install_hugo()

setwd(&quot;/myWebsiteDirectory/&quot;)

blogdown::new_site(theme = &quot;nurlansu/hugo-sustain&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>I later decided I also wanted to add in a CV page with the Vitae format, so I created a subdirectory for those pages:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setwd(&quot;/myWebsiteDirectory/vitae&quot;)

blogdown::new_site(theme = &quot;nurlansu/hugo-vitae&quot;)</code></pre>
