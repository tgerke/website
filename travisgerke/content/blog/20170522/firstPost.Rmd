Needing a site redesign, I spent several weeks fiddling with skeleton and, later, Foundation off and on. There just weren't enough hours in the day. Then, I spotted the following tweet from Julia Silge.

This prompted the following git commit from me:

Now, just over a week later, I've got a site! Who would have thought web design could be done mostly in R?

I won't give a thorough walkthrough; thankfully, this has been beautifully covered by Amber Thomas <a href="https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/">here</a>, and she and Yihui Xie are currently working on a web-book <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">here</a>. Here are the few lines that built this thing though:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("rstudio/blogdown")
blogdown::install_hugo()

setwd("/myWebsiteDirectory/")

blogdown::new_site(theme = "nurlansu/hugo-sustain")
```

I'm using the Sustain theme from XXX, but you can generally pick from most of the Hugo themes. I later decided I also wanted to add in a CV page with the Vitae format, so I created a subdirectory for those pages:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("/myWebsiteDirectory/vitae")

blogdown::new_site(theme = "nurlansu/hugo-vitae")
```

Since the vitae theme is essentially a single html page, I simply tailored it the way I wanted and copied the index.html file over from the public folder into the content directory of my Sustain-themed main site.
