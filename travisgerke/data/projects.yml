    description: Logistic push is a framework we developed for partial AUC optimization. Because the method is based on penalized regressions, it can be used in high-dimensional settings and can perform feature selection with pAUC as the objective function.

    description: Several current projects focus on the use of non-standard objective functions to increase utility of classifiers from high-dimensional data. Of particular interest are objectives that behave well with imbalanced data (few cases, many controls) and time-dependent measures.
