      <description>Needing a site redesign, I spent several weeks fiddling with skeleton and, later, Foundation off and on. There just weren’t enough hours in the day. Then, I spotted the following tweet from Julia Silge.
  This prompted the following git commit from me:   Now, just over a week later, I’ve got a site! Who would have thought web design could be done mostly in R?
I won’t give a thorough walkthrough; thankfully, this has been beautifully covered by Amber Thomas here, and she and Yihui Xie are currently working on a web-book here.</description>
