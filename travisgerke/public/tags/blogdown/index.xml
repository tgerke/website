      <description>Needing a site redesign, I spent several weeks fiddling with skeleton and, later, Foundation off and on. There just weren’t enough hours in the day. Then, I spotted the following tweet from Julia Silge, and just over a week later, all is good using blogdown. Who would have thought web design could be done mostly in R?
I won’t give a thorough walkthrough; thankfully, this has been beautifully covered by Amber Thomas here, and the authors of blogdown are currently working on a web-book here.</description>
