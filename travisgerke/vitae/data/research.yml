   My active line of research lies in integrative molecular cancer epidemiology, and is driven by concurrent interests in biostatistical methods development and computational biology. Several of my recent publications investigate tumor-based biomarkers (DNA/mRNA/protein) that can distinguish aggressive from non-aggressive prostate cancers in large prospective cohorts. My methodological interests in this area concern ways in which high-dimensional data analysis techniques can be modified to discover markers that are highly specific for indolent cancer types. With regard to computational biology and statistics, I also collaborate on efforts to streamline processing, analysis, and epidemiologic translation of large-scale genomic databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus. My programming language of choice is R, though I am also fluent in SAS and Python. Finally, an emerging research interest of mine applies contemporary methods in causal inference to existing clinical trial data in order to discover optimal treatment sequences for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
