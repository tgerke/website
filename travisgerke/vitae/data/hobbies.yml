name: About me
source:
  My wife and I enjoy living in Tampa with our two boys, ages 2 and 3. I didn't have plans to become a scientist; after graduating high school, I spent several years as a touring musician and/or as a general construction laborer with a focus in HVAC. I eventually thought I'd try out something different, so I enrolled in some math classes at a local community college. Then, I enrolled in more math classes, ad infinitum. These days, my hobbies consist of coaching T-Ball, teaching my kids to skateboard (for which they may be too young and I may be too old), and generally loving every minute of chasing after two toddlers.
